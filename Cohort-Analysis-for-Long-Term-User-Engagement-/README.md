# Cohort Analysis for Long Term User Engagement
## Overview
* This project conducts cohort analysis to track long-term user engagement, uncover retention trends, and inform strategies for sustainable business growth.

 ### Methodology
 * Formed user cohorts based on their first purchase month.
 * Tracked engagement over time and calculated retention rates for cohort ages (1 to 4 months).
 * Utilized advanced spreadsheet techniques, including data filtering, pivot table creation, and retention rate calculations.
 * Implemented a structured approach using monthly cohorts.

 ### Key Insights 
 * After one month, an average of 4-6% of users remained engaged.
 * Significant drop in retention observed over four months.
 * Identified the need for improved retention strategies for long-term user engagement.

### Data Utilization 
* Utilized e-commerce transaction logs from September 2020 to February 2021.
* Focused on the "first_purchase_month" column to form cohorts.

### Results

### Communication 
* Communicated findings through clear data visualization and presentation.
* Emphasized the significance of developing and implementing effective long-term user retention strategies.

### Impact
